Goal is to test if Timp3 has differential 3' UTR usage in tabula sapiens samples

I should be able to start with the ReadZs counts files instead of doing a rerun

Roozbeh shared the counts files outputs here: /oak/stanford/groups/horence/Roozbeh/single_cell_project/processed_files/ReadZS/count_files

I'll do the following steps
1.  grep for Timp3 gene location in humans which is on chr22
    Timp3 is a positive strand gene in humans but overlaps with Syn3, a negative strand gene
    I'll not filter out negative strand reads yet but might do that further in the processing
    I can also grep for the bins within the 3' UTR region approximately 32,859,136-32,863,072 (I assume 5kb bins?)
    which is either bin 6572 or 6573 (ReadZs rounds up the bin numbers)

    Here's the command I'm using for TSP1:
    grep -e "chr22_6572" -e "chr22_6573" /oak/stanford/groups/horence/Roozbeh/single_cell_project/processed_files/ReadZS/count_files/TSP*10X/* > timp3_counts.tsv


2.  Then I'll map the cell-types to the individual cells
    The combined metadata is /oak/stanford/groups/horence/Roozbeh/single_cell_project/utility_files/meta_data/Tabula_Sapiens/TSP1_TSP15_scvi_donor-method_normalized-log1p-scaled_annotated.csv
    
    Code is in the jupyter notebook timp3_readzs_other_samples.ipynb

    I'll then save out a table with the following columns:
        pilot,tissue,10X_barcode,chr,pos,strand,count,sample,window,file_name,extended_cell_id,compartment,consensus_prediction

    Output table is timp3_annotated_counts.csv which has a row for each cell/position/count


3.  Collapse the position counts for each sample/ontology

    Here is what the table looks like:
    
    pilot   tissue  compartment consensus_prediction    pos strand  count
    0   TSP1    bladder stromal fibroblast  32855135    -   1
    1   TSP1    bladder stromal fibroblast  32855314    +   1
    2   TSP1    bladder stromal fibroblast  32855457    +   1
    3   TSP1    bladder stromal fibroblast  32855499    +   1
    4   TSP1    bladder stromal fibroblast  32855583    +   1

    Code in the jupyter notebook

    Double checked that the min position was near where I expected (32,855,021), and same for max position (32,864,804)

    saved the table as: sample_ont_pos_timp3_counts.csv

    there are 85,547 reads aligning to the plus strand (expected) and 7,234 aligning to the minus strand

    There are only 4 unique consensus_predictions
    fibroblast
    capillary endothelial cell
    type i pneumocyte
    cd4-positive helper t cell


4.  Make eCDF plots
