    "Simple code to create two-panel plots that have SRRS score and ReadZs score correlation along with read buildup plots to facilitate making many plots quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs\n",
    "1. SRRS gene/cell score table\n",
    "2. ReadZs score table (median score?)\n",
    "3. ReadZs count table\n",

    "It feels difficult to manage to have 3 large input files\n",
    "\n",
    "Can I use the bam's instead of the ReadZs outputs? The bams don't have cell-type info however. I could add the cell-type info to the bam's using the flag field, or a custom field. Then I'd have to calculate ReadZs myself though. This would be very helpful but could be a time-sink so I'll spend one only 1 hour on it and start with just a single file"
